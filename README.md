## If we are providing arguments to a function instead of a list or tuple we use the concept of *
So whenever we do not specify the contents into tuple , list , dictionary and just initialize it as just arguments, we use to concept of * , when we apply * in front of any name , it converts the items in that name into tuple and thus the loop iterates through each element in it 
*args allows you to pass any number of positional arguments to a function.
The arguments are collected into a tuple.
You can iterate through *args to access each argument.

You can use *args along with other fixed arguments:

If we don't want to use function we can use a new concept known as lambda
