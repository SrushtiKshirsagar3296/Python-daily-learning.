## If we are providing arguments to a function instead of a list or tuple we use the concept of *
So whenever we do not specify the contents into tuple , list , dictionary and just initialize it as just arguments, we use to concept of * , when we apply * in front of any name , it converts the items in that name into tuple and thus the loop iterates through each element in it
